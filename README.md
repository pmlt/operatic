# operatic

`operatic` is a wrapper program around the DOSBox OPL3 emulator.

## Requirements

This program requires `SDL2` and `SDL2_ttf` development libraries to compile. CMake is used as the build tool. You need a recent C++ compiler as well.

## License

`operatic` is licensed under the GPLv2. Credits go to:

* The DOSBox team for writing the actual emulation (https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging)
* @rofl0r for doing the hard work of ripping out the DOSBox emulator and turning it into a usable library (https://github.com/rofl0r/dbopl)
